# otp

## This is a OTP (One Time Pad) encryption and decryption program. This program
## generates three files. The first two are the key (otp.txt) and the encrypted
## message (ciphertext.txt). Send the key to the recipient securely (e.g. USB)
## and send the message any way you wish, just not togeather. The thrid file
## (message.txt) is the decrypted message created when using the decryption 
## function.
